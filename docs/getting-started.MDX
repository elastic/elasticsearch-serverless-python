This page guides you through the installation process of the Serverless <<[LANG]>> 
client, shows you how to instantiate the client, and how to perform basic 
Elasticsearch operations with it.


## Requirements

* <<[LANG]>> x or higher installed on your system.


## Installation


### Using the command line

You can install the Elasticsearch Serverless <<[LANG]>> client with the following 
commands:

```bash
```


## Instantiate a client

You can instantiate a client by running the following command:

```<<[lang]>>

```

You can find the Elasticsearch endpoint on the Cloud deployment management page.

You can create a new API Key under **Stack Management** > **Security**:

## Using the API

After you instantiated a client with your API key and Elasticsearch endpoint, 
you can start ingesting documents into the Elasticsearch Service. You can use 
the Bulk API for this. This API enables you to index, update, and delete several 
documents in one request.


### Creating an index and ingesting documents

You can call the `bulk` API with a body parameter, an array of hashes that 
define the action, and a document. 

The following is an example of indexing some classic books into the `books` 
index:

```<<[lang]>>

```

When you use the client to make a request to Elasticsearch, it returns an API 
response object. You can check the HTTP return code by calling `status` and the 
HTTP headers by calling `headers` on the response object. The response object 
also behaves as a Hash, so you can access the body values directly as seen on 
the previous example with ``.


### Searching

Now that some data is available, you can search your documents using the 
**Search API**:

```<<[lang]>>
```
